⭕ jsonplaceholder API:

   * Add a todo item, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the item in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you won’t be able to add items to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).

   * Delete an item, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
